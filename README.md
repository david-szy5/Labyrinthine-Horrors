### Game Overview
<a name="overview"/>

_Labyrinthine Horrors_ is a first-person, horror-themed maze extraction game brought to you by a team of five new but talented game developers. Developed iteratively over the course of the spring 2023 semester, _Labyrinthine Horrors_ demands players to navigate the dangers of the complex mazes in which they find themselves lost and forsaken. Players must carefully explore the maze in search of a key that leads to their escape. Be careful to not make too much noise, however...or _it_ will get you.

#### Role Descriptions
<a name="role-desc"/>

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Captain | The Captain is responsible for leading the team and be the first person the teaching staff talk to. Some of the common responsibilities of a Captain include: coordinating team meetings, discussing and assigning tasks, (usually) presenting to the teaching staff, collating and updating the weekly task sheet. |
| Note Taker | The Note Taker is responsible for making sure the team takes note on teaching staff feedback as well as playtest feedback. |
| Analytics/Project Manager | While the whole team works on analytics, the PMs are responsible for the analytic side of the project. This means 1) Figuring out what analytic would be useful to guide game development 2) Having data-collection capabilities in Unity 3) Collecting the right data 4) Interpreting the resulting data 5) Discuss how to address the data. |
| Physics | Those charged with the Physics role are required to know the ins and outs of the Unity Physics System. They should know how to set up a rigidbody to work with Colliders, how to apply forces to move rigidbodies, how to move rigidbodies without forces, how layers can be used to managed physics of GameObjects, etc. |
| User Interface | Those tasked with implementing user interface know the ins and outs of Unity's User Interface and TextMeshPro. One must know when to use the Unity UI and when to use Immediate Mode GUI. You should also know the difference between the Canvas Render Mode (Screen Space - Overlay, Screen Space - Camera, and World Space). |
| Gameplay | Just like everyone on your team can (and should) participate in game design, everyone should be responsible for gameplay. Coordinates the development of new game features. |
| Game Feel | The goal of game feel is, as its name suggests, to make the game feel good to play. Game Feel is similar to User Interface. Those with the Game Feel role are responsible for adding in features to improve game feel, such as camera shake, vignette effect, text pop up, etc. |
| Artificial Intelligence | Those on the AI team will be responsible for making characters come to life with character behavior and pathfinding. |
| Player Guidance | Player guidance is about gently nudging players in the right direction. Some examples include providing on-screen tips after a few seconds, designing levels in such a way that the player needs to master the current game mechanic before moving on, or using visual elements (color, lighting, and shape) to encourage players to make certain decisions. |
| Models | Modelers are in charge of creating the physical assets that a game requires--such as weapons, player models and buildings--and subsequently applying textures and shaders. |
| Animation | Animators are in charge of creating and implementing player, enemy, environmental and UI animations. |
| Audio | Those with the Audio role are in charge of creating or (predominantly) sourcing audio and overseeing its subsequent implementation in the game. |
