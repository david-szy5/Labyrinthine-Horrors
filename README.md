### Game Overview
<a name="overview"/>

_Labyrinthine Horrors_ is a first-person, horror-themed maze extraction game brought to you by a team of five new but talented game developers. Developed iteratively over the course of the spring 2023 semester, _Labyrinthine Horrors_ demands players to navigate the dangers of the complex mazes in which they find themselves lost and forsaken. Players must carefully explore the maze in search of a key that leads to their escape. Be careful to not make too much noise, however...or _it_ will get you.
