### Game Overview
<a name="overview"/>

_Labyrinthine Horrors_ is a first-person, horror-themed maze extraction game brought to you by a team of five new but talented game developers. Developed iteratively over the course of the spring 2023 semester, _Labyrinthine Horrors_ demands players to navigate the dangers of the complex mazes in which they find themselves lost and forsaken. Players must carefully explore the maze in search of a key that leads to their escape. Be careful to not make too much noise, however...or _it_ will get you.

#### Role Descriptions

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Captain | A non-technical role. The Captain is responsible for leading the team and be the first person the teaching staff talk to. That description is very general, so here are some of the common responsibilities to the Captain. These responsibilities can also be delegated to other team members, but the Captain is responsible for making sure it's done and done well. Coordinating team meetings, discuss and assign tasks, usually presents to the teaching staff, collates and updates task sheet. |
| Note Taker | A non-technical role. Responsible for making sure the team takes note on teaching staff feedback as well as playtest feedback. The notes should be compiled in the GDD (and ideally in task sheet). The team should also discuss those feedback and note down how they plan to address those feedback, which should also be compiled in the GDD (and ideally in task sheet). This doesn't mean the notetaker should be the only person writing down notes, but the note taker will be responsible for ensuring things are being noted down and documented. |
| Analytics | Analytics or previously referred to as Project Manager (PM). While the whole team works on analytics, the PMs are responsible for the analytic side of the project. This means 1) Figuring out what analytic would be useful to guide game development 2) Having Data Collection Capabilities in Unity 3) Collecting the right data 4) Interpreting the resulting data 5) Discuss how to address the data  |
| Physics | Not every game needs to use the Physics System provided by Unity; however, many games do and the team would benefit from having someone that really understands the ins and outs of the Physics System. They should know how to set up a rigidbody to work with Colliders, how to apply forces to move rigidbodies, how to move rigidbodies without forces, how layers can be used to managed physics of GameObjects. |
| User Interface | While we have stressed that no art is allowed until after midterm, the team should definitely be creating user interfaces to make your game easier to understand. You will learn the ins and outs of Unity's User Interface and TextMeshPro. You need to learn when to use the Unity UI and when to use Immediate Mode GUI. You should also know the difference between the Canvas Render Mode (Screen Space - Overlay, Screen Space - Camera, and World Space). |
| Gameplay | Just like everyone on your team can (and should) participate in game design, everyone should be responsible for gameplay. Thus, gameplay does not need to be explicitedly given as a role. If you have a really large teams, then someone may be given this role. This person would not be the only person developing gameplay, but rather, coordinating and making sure everyone can develop new game features as easily as possible. |
| Game Feel | The goal of game feel is, as its name suggests, to make the game feel good to play. While the class has a no-art-until-after-midterm policy, the point is for you to not get too fixated and spend a lot of time putting in art and then be unwilling to make changes to your game mechanics. Game Feel sits in between the two, similar to User Interface. Those with the Game Feel role are responsible for adding in features to improve game feel, such as camera shake, vignette effect, text pop up, etc. |
| Artificial Intelligence | Not every game needs a person dedicated to AI, but many can benefit from it. You will be responsible for making characters come to life with character behavior and pathfinding. It's also possible to explore the more arcane side of AI and work on Director AI where the game system itself responds to the player action. |
| Player Guidance | Player guidance is about gently nudging players in the right direction. It's not about hammering the players with enormous wall of text telling them every single feature you have. You may want to provide an on-screen tip after a few seconds, design levels in such a way so that the player needs to master the current game mechanic before moving on, or use visual elements (color, lighting, and shape) to encourage players to make certain decisions. |
| Models | Modelers are in charge of creating the physical assets that a game requires--such as weapons, player models and buildings--and subsequently applying textures and shaders. |
| Animation | Animators are in charge of creating and implementing player, enemy, environmental and UI animations. |
| Audio | Those with the Audio role are in charge of creating or (predominantly) sourcing audio and its subsequent implementation in the game. |
